## Clarity and Presentation

Ensure all submissions are appropriately clear and easy to read. This includes:

 - Text should be clear and concise.
 - Use section headings as appropriate.
 - Include images in the body of the write-up, with figure numbers and captions as appropriate.
 - Refer to the figures in the body of your text.
 - Check for typos, spelling, and grammar errors.

Be sure your presentation looks good:

 - Choose appropriate colors, fonts, and styles.
 - Make appropriate and liberal use of whitespace.
 - Ensure images are high-quality.

Images do not count against page limits, and are therefore effectively free.
You should embed images throughout your PDF, keeping them near the text that references them.
Page limits apply to the approximate amount of text you would have if all images were removed.
