## Contribution Statements

Please discuss and submit a personal contribution statement every time that you submit a group assignment.
Include this contribution statement at the top of your submission, along with the names of your group members.
Please note that we will not grade submissions where this statement is missing.

An example contribution statement is:

- Name 1: 40%, researched the background of the problem, outlined the content of the document, wrote the first version of one paragraph, also selected the images to be included
- Name 2: 10%, proof-read the PDF, fixed several typos
- Name 3: 25%, wrote the first version of the background section, made sure the final version got submitted
- Name 4: 25%, organized the group meeting, researched the background of the problem, contributed to the formatting of the text

Please know that we do not expect everyone to contribute equally to each assignment,
but you should try to work as a team and support each other.
Likewise, you should work together as a team when discussing each other's contributions.
Please come to us early if you are dealing with unresolved issues regarding unequal contributions.
During the quarter, we may solicit private feedback regarding group dynamics from members.
