<Alert severity="warning">
<h4 style={{marginTop: 0}}>Excluded Topics</h4>

Some topics can initially appeal to students (e.g., because they correspond to real problems students have encountered),
but then ultimately do not support strong differentiation and learning in the project sequence.
To help ensure a broader set of project explorations, we have declared some topics to be excluded.

**You may not propose a project focused on the domain of home grocery tracking or planning.**

If you feel you have an idea that should be allowed in spite of this exclusion
(e.g., because the project is differentiated by targeting a specific class of people that opens new ideas),
contact the course staff for approval before proposing it.
