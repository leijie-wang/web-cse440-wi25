# Assignment 3: Getting the Design Right

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

## Overview

Now that you have chosen a design, it is time to iteratively refine that design.
This group assignment, spanning multiple weeks of the course, tackles the problem
of getting the design right through __paper prototyping__, __inspection__, and
__usability testing__. Design refinement culminates in a __digital mockup__.

## Milestones and Deliverables

This is a group assignment, consisting of six milestones.

{/*
  *
  * ASSIGNMENT 3A
  *
  */}
<CollapseProjectMilestone assignment={calendarData.assignments.assignment3a}>

The goal of this milestone is to develop an initial paper prototype that will begin to allow testing of your design.

Develop a paper prototype for your design.
It should convey critical components of your design, including support for testing your two primary tasks.

- Include an overview image that shows your entire paper prototype.
- The prototype should be complete for each task,
  including enough detail to show how to complete each step in the task.
  This should include the desired / expected / intended path, but also likely error conditions
  (e.g., what happens if some participant input is invalid?).
- The prototype should be at an appropriate level of detail,
  supporting understanding of critical components of your design and the context of the your primary tasks.
- The documentation in your report should explain how the components of your prototype are related.
  This should include detailed images showing each component as you walk through your two primary tasks.

This prototype has been informed by your prior sketching and storyboarding.
But it also contains more details than your prior exploratory designs.
If necessary or appropriate, revise your tasks or scenarios based on what you learn in prototyping.

<InformalDrawingTool />

If you use an informal drawing tool,
you will need to have physical copies of your paper prototype throughout upcoming milestones.
You will also need the ability to quickly iterate on your paper prototype.

#### Submission

No more than one page of text in PDF format, to include:

- An overview image that shows your entire paper prototype.
- Detailed images showing each component as you walk through your two primary tasks.

Be sure:

- <GroupAssignment />
- <ClarityAndPresentationReference />
- <ContributionStatementReference />
- <ParticipantAnonymity />

Submit via Canvas here:

<AssignmentSubmitCanvasLink assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment3a} />

#### In Class

Bring your paper prototype to class.
You will need it to conduct a heuristic evaluation during class.

#### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __10 points__:

1. __Overall Completeness and Appropriateness of Paper Prototype__: (2 points)

   Include an overview image.

   Include enough detail to support understanding of
   critical components of your design and the context of your primary tasks.

2. __Completeness, Appropriateness, and Documentation of Each Task__: (2 x 3 points)

   Include each step in the task, with enough detail to show how to complete each step.

3. __Clarity and Presentation__: (2 points)

#### Samples of Prior Submissions

<ProjectMilestoneSamples milestone='assignment3a' />

</CollapseProjectMilestone>

{/*
  *
  * ASSIGNMENT 3B
  *
  */}
<CollapseProjectMilestone assignment={calendarData.assignments.assignment3b}>

The goal of this milestone is to conduct heuristic evaluations as part of rapidly iterating on your paper prototype.

You will receive an evaluation in class, and you will supplement this with another evaluation.

In class, pair with another team to conduct heuristic evaluations.
One team will conduct a heuristic evaluation of the otherâ€™s paper prototype, then the two teams will reverse roles.
Each team will therefore conduct and receive one heuristic evaluation.

We will provide a worksheet with Nielsen's heuristics:

<p><a href={Paths.basePath + path3bNielsenHeuristics}>3b-nielsen-heuristics.pdf</a></p>

For each issue identified in evaluation, record:
- The heuristic that is violated.
- A description of the usability issue, including an image of the relevant portion of the prototype.
- A severity rating (ranging from 0 for _no problem_ to 4 for _usability catastrophe_).

Revise your paper prototype based on what you learn in heuristic evaluation.
Your tasks and scenarios are likely stable, but revise them if your evaluation reveals a need.

Outside of class, arrange to receive a second heuristic evaluation (e.g., with another team).
You therefore received two heuristic evaluations of your paper prototype.
If desired, you may also conduct a heuristic evaluation or cognitive walkthrough of your own paper prototype.

#### Submission and Grading

Records of your inspection-based methods will be submitted as part of later assignments (eg., see Assignment 3c).

Be sure to keep detailed records, including images of relevant portions of the prototype before and after revisions.

#### Samples of Prior Submissions

See samples of Assignment 3c.

</CollapseProjectMilestone>

{/*
  *
  * ASSIGNMENT 3C
  *
  */}
<CollapseProjectMilestone assignment={calendarData.assignments.assignment3c}>

The goal of this milestone is to document changes resulting from your inspection-based analyses
and to begin usability testing of your revised prototype with participants.

Complete one usability test with your paper prototype, examining your two primary tasks.

Target an appropriate participant based on your design research and resulting design.

Be sure to divide your team into roles when conducting a usability test.
There is simply too much required for a single person to effectively conduct a test.
As discussed in class, roles include the facilitator, the computer, and one or more observers.

As part of your introduction, have your facilitator show the participant how to interact with your design.
Do not show participants how to perform your tasks that you will later test.
Instead show them how paper prototyping works, how your system generally works,
and give an example of something specific that is sufficiently different from your tasks.

During the test, record a log of critical incidents, including both positive and negative events.
For example, a person might comment on something they like or might make a mistake in a task.
Record the incident along with a description of the context of the incident.

Consider recording your tests to allow you to see and show exactly what happened.
If you do this, obtain permission from the participant and ensure your recording preserves the anonymity of the participant.
Frame your shot such that you capture interaction with the prototype without unnecessarily capturing the participant.

Each participant should perform both of your primary tasks.
Keep the data separate for each participant and each task.
Remember participation must be voluntary, participants should be free to stop at any time,
and you should emphasize that your focus is on identifying usability issues in the design.

Revise your paper prototype based on what you learn in usability testing.
This can and should include fixing major issues as soon as they are detected, before additional tests.
Your tasks and scenarios are likely stable, but revise them if your evaluation reveals a need.

Present your iterative revisions and your plan going forward:

- Present a table or list of results from your inspection-based methods.
  We expect you will report at least **four** identified issues and resulting revisions, which may be small or large.
  You may report more, but this is the expected minimum.
  For each identified issue, include:
  - The heuristic that is violated.
  - A description of the usability issue, including an image of the relevant portion of the prototype.
  - A severity rating (ranging from 0 for _no problem_ to 4 for _usability catastrophe_).
  - An image and explanation of any revision implemented as a result.
    If you highlight an issue without revising in response to it, provide explanation of that decision.

- Discuss your first usability test.
  - Provide a description of your testing method and participant
    (e.g., the participant, the environment where you conducted the test,
    why you chose this participant and environment, the test protocol,
    and the roles of each team member who participated in the test).
  - Discuss anything you learned about the testing process itself.
    This should include at least one part of your method that was especially effective
    or one revision you decided you need to make to your testing process.

- Present a table or list of results from your first usability test.
  We expect you will report at least **two** identified incidents, which may be small or large.
  You may report more, but this is the expected minimum.
  For each critical incident, include:
  - An image of the relevant portion of the prototype.
  - Description of the incident, remembering that these can be either positive or negative.
  - For negative incidents, a severity rating (ranging from 0 for _no problem_ to 4 for _usability catastrophe_).
  - For negative incidents, an image and explanation of any revision implemented as a result.
  - For positive incidents, describe what was learned from this incident.

- Submit detailed images of your current paper prototype, as revised in this process.
  Your design may have changed more or less,
  so this is intended to fully convey the current state of your design.
  As before, ensure your prototype is complete, is at an appropriate level of detail, and documents each task.
  Include both:
  - An overview image that shows your entire paper prototype.
  - Detailed images showing each component as you walk through your two primary tasks.

- Present your plan for the remainder of your usability tests.
  Describe what goals you have for the additional tests and any new approaches you will employ.
  You will conduct one usability test in section,
  describe your plans for recruiting an additional participant.

As you assemble this documentation of the iterative improvement of your design,
you may find that some changes feel minor relative to the overhead of documenting those changes.
Your goals in this documentation are to:

- Show your work in the iterative design process, giving enough insight to understand your progress.
- Capture a record to which you can return in preparing your web content and presentation.

You may choose to not fully document minor changes, but be sure to document enough for these two goals.

<CollapseProjectMilestone assignment={calendarData.assignments.assignment3d}>

The goal of this milestone is to complete usability testing of your prototype with participants.

Complete a total of at least three usability tests and finalize your paper prototype according to what you learn.

Present the results of your usability testing and your final paper prototype:

- Discuss your three usability tests.
  - Provide a description of your testing method and participant
    (e.g., the participant, the environment where you conducted the test,
    why you chose this participant and environment, the test protocol,
    and the roles of each team member who participated in the test).
  - Briefly discuss anything you learned about the testing process itself.
    This should include at least one part of your method that was especially effective
    or one revision you decided to make to your testing process.

- Present a table or list of results from your three usability tests.
  We expect you will report at least **three** identified incidents, which may be small or large.
  You may report more, but this is the expected minimum.
  This may include incidents you previously reported from your first usability test,
  but may also be completely different in order to focus on the most important incidents you want to report.
  For each critical incident, include:
  - An image of the relevant portion of the prototype.
  - Description of the incident, remembering that these can be either positive or negative.
  - For negative incidents, a severity rating (ranging from 0 for _no problem_ to 4 for _usability catastrophe_).
  - For negative incidents, an image and explanation of any revision implemented as a result.
  - For positive incidents, describe what was learned from this incident.

- Submit detailed images of your final paper prototype, as revised in this process.
  Your design may have changed more or less,
  so this is intended to fully convey the current state of your design.
  As before, ensure your prototype is complete, is at an appropriate level of detail, and documents each task.
  Include both:
  - An overview image that shows your entire paper prototype.
  - Detailed images showing each component as you walk through your two primary tasks.

- Discuss two to four revisions that you consider to be your most salient and important modifications
  based on issues identified in inspection, usability testing, or critique.
  These may already be included in the above list, but discuss them in more detail and argue why detecting and fixing them is important to your design.

- Discuss at least one revision you made to promote inclusivity in your design.
  Describe an unintentional assumption you identified in your design,
  then describe how you revised your design to address this assumption.
  If you are unable to identify this before this submission is due,
  you may discuss this more in section and submit a revised assignment adding this.

As you assemble this documentation of the iterative improvement of your design,
you may find that some changes feel minor relative to the overhead of documenting those changes.
Your goals in this documentation are to:

- Show your work in the iterative design process, giving enough insight to understand your progress.

  */}
<CollapseProjectMilestone assignment={calendarData.assignments.assignment3e}>

The goal of this milestone is to transition your prototype into a digital mockup of your design.

Create your digital mockup based on your final paper prototype.
Do not begin working in digital prototyping until you finish revising your paper prototype.
It is much easier to iterate on your design in the paper prototyping phase.

As you transition into digital prototyping, you will need to consider other aspects of the design.
This can include detail you may not have previously considered (e.g., visual design, layout, color, typography),
but can also include constraints or mismatches introduced by the technology itself.
Note decisions or changes you need to make as you transition from paper to a digital representation.

The mockup should effectively communicate your design in a manner appropriate for your web content, presentation, and poster.
Implement your digital mockup to include key frames that illustrate your design.
It should convey all critical aspects of your design, including walkthroughs for your two primary tasks.

We have no strong preference regarding what digital tools you use to create your mockup.
But it must be digital (e.g., you may not use pictures of a hand-drawn sketch).
Some tools support creation of interactive mockups (e.g., allow clicking active regions to move between screens).
You are welcome to use such a tool, and such interactivity may be helpful.
But interactive mockups are neither expected nor required.

Figma is a widely-used web-based collaborative tool:

 - [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

 - [Omnigraffle](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle)
 - [Vectr](https://vectr.com/)

Present your digital mockup together with discussion of the decisions and changes you made:

- Submit detailed images of your digital mockup. Include both:
  - Overview images that show your digital mockup.
  - Detailed images showing each component as you walk through your two primary tasks.

- Discuss decisions and changes you made in implementing the digital mockup.
  - We expect you will report at least **three** decisions or changes you made, which may be small or large.
    You may report more, but this is the expected minimum.
  - Describe each decision or change in a few sentences,
    including why the change was necessary or desired.
    Include images to be sure it is easy to understand the decision or change.

As you assemble this documentation of the iterative improvement of your design,
you may find that some changes feel minor relative to the overhead of documenting those changes.
Your goals in this documentation are to:

- Show your work in the iterative design process, giving enough insight to understand your progress.
- Capture a record to which you can return in preparing your web content and presentation.

You may choose to not fully document minor changes, but be sure to document enough for these two goals.

  * ASSIGNMENT 3P
  *
  */}
<CollapseProjectMilestone assignment={calendarData.assignments.assignment3p}>

The goal of this milestone is to effectively communicate your design prototyping in a presentation.

Prepare a presentation of your process in getting the design right. It should encompass all of your work in Assignment 3.

- Two members of your team should deliver the presentation, each speaking to relatively equal portions.
- Presenters should be different from those for Assignment 2, such that everybody presents at least once this quarter.
  If there is some reason this cannot work for your team, be sure you have communicated with us.
- A 7 minute time limit will be strictly enforced, with additional time for questions.

A suggested organization of this presentation is:

1. __Title Slide__:

   A short, creative, and marketable title capturing the key idea.

   Include team member names. Be clear which team members are presenting.

2. __Overall Problem__:

   Convey that your problem is both important and appropriate for a design investigation.

   Motivate your audience to be interested in your problem and your proposed solution.
   Remember that you are teaching us what you learned in your process, you are not "selling" your solution.
   Be sure to avoid simply reading slide bullets, as you need to develop a connection to your audience.

3. __Initial Paper Prototype__:

   Present your initial paper prototype.
   Convey the critical aspects of your design, including the two primary tasks being refined in your paper prototype.

4. __Testing Process__:

   Present your process for iteratively improving your design, including:
   - your methods (i.e., what methods did you use to improve your initial design),
   - your participants (i.e., what participants did you engage).

5. __Testing Results and Prototype Refinement__:

   Present usability and design issues that you identified and iterative improvements you made to address those issues.
   This will include changes from your heuristic evaluation, usability testing, and design critique.

   Discuss identified issues as an appropriate level of detail, including:
   - specific usability issues that were identified and corrected (e.g., consider before and after comparisons),
   - higher-level findings and themes that emerged (e.g., consider explaining a specific issue that was identified and how it led to a larger revision of the design).

6. __Final Paper Prototype__:

   Present your final paper prototype.
   Convey the critical aspects of your design, including the two primary tasks.
   This might be shorter than your presentation of the initial paper prototype,
   because you already presented changes and are about to present the digital mockup.
   This might also have been part of your testing process and results, if changes were illustrated there.

7. __Digital Mockup__:

   Present your digital mockup.
   Convey the critical aspects of your design, including the two primary tasks.
   Discuss any significant changes that were required when transitioning from a paper prototype.

We strongly recommend rehearsing your presentation beforehand.
For example, arrange to practice together with another group or two, giving each other feedback on your presentations.

Note that we have not set a required number of slides in each section of this presentation.
You can deliver your presentation using as many or as few slides as you want,
as long as your presentation successfully addresses the above points in the allowed time.

#### Submission

Your presentation may be in PPT, PPTX, or PDF format.

To minimize switching time, we will have all presentations on a single laptop running Microsoft Windows.
You should optimize your presentation for portability (e.g., ensure any necessary fonts are embedded).
If we detect any obvious formatting issues on the presentation machine, we may fix them or contact you to fix them.
But you are ultimately responsible for your presentation.

### Grading

The course staff will have a grading form they keep during your presentation:

<p><a href={Paths.basePath + path3pPresentationStaffForm}>3p-presentation-staff-form.pdf</a></p>

The content of this presentation will be graded on a scale of __16 points__:

- Presentations should not have an outline slide.
  They are short enough to be told as a story of your process, and your outline is the same as every other presentation.
  Instead use that time to tell us about your project.
- The problem and your proposed solution should be presented in a manner that is compelling,
  should teach us what you learned in your process rather than "selling" your solution.
- The initial prototype should be effectively conveyed through two scenarios.
- The process of iteratively improving the design should be effectively conveyed and appropriate for the design.
- Findings and iterative improvements of the design should be effectively conveyed.
- The final design, as represented by your digital mockup, should be effectively conveyed through two scenarios.
- Presentations should show appropriate preparation,
  with slides that are legible and content that is effective, properly prepared, and properly employed.
- Presentations should cover the required scope within the allowed time.

The delivery of this presentation will be graded on a scale of __4 points__:

- Presenter makes eye contact with the audience.
- Presenter projects their voice well and is audible throughout the room.
- Presenter feels engaged with the content, not just reading slides.
- Presenter covers the required scope within the allowed time.
