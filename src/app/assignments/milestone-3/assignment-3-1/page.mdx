# Assignment 3.1: Task Review

<UnderDevelopment display={false} />

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_3_1} />

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_3_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

The goal of this assignment is to build on what you learned in your design research
to develop a set of tasks that you will guide your exploration of potential designs.

Informed by your design research, provide brief and appropriate answers to the following task analysis questions.
These should help you begin to identify tasks that are essential to a design.

1. Who is going to use the design?
2. What tasks do they now perform?
3. What tasks are desired?
4. How are the tasks learned?
5. Where are the tasks performed?
6. What is the relationship between the person and data?
7. What other tools does the person have?
8. How do people communicate with each other?
9. How often are the tasks performed?
10. What are the time constraints on the tasks?
11. What happens when things go wrong?

After completing your task analysis, identify __six tasks__ that you believe are important to your design goal:

- Remember that tasks say what is accomplished, while leaving open how to accomplish it.
- Select tasks to capture important aspects of the problem you are addressing.
  Your six tasks should span a range of functionality,
  thus providing coverage of the problem for potential designs.
- Create tasks based on your observations and analyses of existing tasks
  (i.e., tasks people already do)
  as well as your vision for new tasks
  (i.e., tasks that could be enabled by potential designs).

Each task should be presented as a brief sentence concisely conveying a problem or what is accomplished.
The task should then be supported by a paragraph story providing additional context and details.
Context and details might be based on what you found in your design research or your task analysis,
such as certain goals or values a person may bring to a situation,
the context in which a task is performed,
a narrative motivating how and why the task emerges as important for a person to accomplish,
and specific details that are relevant to completing the task.
Such details can then be explored in scenarios with potential designs you will develop in later assignments.

Tasks should not be specific to any specific potential design,
as you will develop those in later assignments.
Although it can be helpful to describe a task in the context of a specific story,
the task itself should be more general and potentially achieved using different potential designs.

As you progress in your project, you can and should consider revising your tasks.
Expect to refine or change your tasks as your understanding of the problem matures or according to feedback.
The tasks you develop in this assignment therefore must be appropriate but are not necessarily final.

## Submission

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_3_1} />

Within the Drive folder for course project files:

- Identify the Slides deck corresponding to this assignment for your group.
  The deck provides a template for this assignment.
  Edit the deck in-place, so that you can easily share it in critique.

- Prepare a Slides deck with the following structure:

  - 1/2 slide for each Task Analysis Question (6 slides total)
  - 1 slide for each task, consisting of:
    - A concise statement of the task.
    - A paragraph story providing additional context and details.

Reminders and requirements:

- Submission via Canvas is also required, in support of grading.
  - Remove instruction slides and template markings from your deck before submission.

  - Export a PDF of your deck, via the menu: File -> Download -> PDF Document (.pdf).
