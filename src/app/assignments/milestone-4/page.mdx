# Milestone 4: Getting the Design Right

<UnderDevelopment display={false} />

## Overview

You are to use two key tasks to further detail and then iteratively refine your design.
You will first develop a paper prototype that can support inspection and usability testing of your design.
You will then pursue an iterative process of refining that prototype
according to insights identified through inspection and through critical incidents in usability testing.
