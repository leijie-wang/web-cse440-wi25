# Assignment 4.3: Usability Testing

<UnderDevelopment display={false} />

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_4_3} />

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_4_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

The goal of this milestone is to document revisions resulting from heuristic evaluation,
then to continue rapidly iterating on your paper prototype
informed by usability testing of your prototype with participants.

Complete a total of at least three usability tests examining your two focus tasks.
Target appropriate participants based on your design research and resulting design.
Finalize your paper prototype according to what you learn.

Be sure to divide your team into roles when conducting a usability test.
There is simply too much required for a single person to effectively conduct a test.
As discussed in class, roles include the facilitator, the computer, and one or more observers.

As part of your introduction, have your facilitator show the participant how to interact with your design.
Do not show participants how to perform your focus tasks that you will later test.
Instead show them how paper prototyping works, how your system generally works,
and give an example of something specific that is sufficiently different from your tasks.

Ask participants to talk aloud during usability tests.
Maintain a log of critical incidents, including both positive and negative events.
For example, a person might comment on something they like or might make a mistake in a task.
Capture the incident along with a description of the context of the incident.

Consider recording your tests to allow you to see and show exactly what happened.
If you do this, obtain permission from the participant and ensure your recording preserves participant anonymity.
Frame your recording so you capture interaction with the prototype without unnecessarily capturing the participant.

Each participant should perform both of your focus tasks.
Keep the data separate for each participant and each focus task.
Remember participation must be voluntary, participants must be free to stop at any time,
and you should emphasize that your focus is on identifying usability issues in the design.

Revise your paper prototype based on what you learn in usability testing.
This can and should include fixing major issues as soon as they are detected, before additional tests.

Your focus tasks and stories are likely stable, but revise them if your evaluation reveals a need.

Present your iterative revisions, the results of your usability testing, and your final paper prototype:

- Present **3 revisions made in response to inspection-based evaluation**.

  These will most likely be revisions made in response to heuristic evaluation in Assignment 4.2,
  but you may also revisit inspection of your own paper prototype for potential usability issues.
  Revisions may be small or large, depending on the identified usability issue.

  For each revision, include:
  - Where in the prototype you identified a potential usability issue.
    Include at least one image of the relevant portion of the prototype.
  - A heuristic that is violated. A description of the usability issue.
  - A description of the revision.
  - At least one image of revisions to the relevant portion of the prototype.

- Provide a description of your **usability testing method**.

  Describe your testing method and participants, emphasizing how you structured usability testing to learn
  (e.g., how you structured the usability testing sessions,
  any details of usability testing you designed to support learning about your prototype,
  how you presented usability testing tasks to participants,
  any relevant details of participants in usability testing).

  If your method changed between sessions, explain what changes you made and why you made them.

- Present **4 revisions made in response to usability testing**.

  Revisions may be small or large, depending on the identified usability issue.
  For each revision, include:
  - At least one image of the relevant portion of the prototype.
  - Description of the critical incident that prompted revision,
    remembering that these can be either positive or negative.
  - A description of the revision.
  - At least one image of revisions to the relevant portion of the prototype.

- Present **1 revision made to address unintentional exclusion in your design**.

  For this revision, include:
  - At least one image of the relevant portion of the prototype.
  - Description of an unintentional assumption identified in your design,
    including how this assumption would unintentionally exclude people from your design.
  - A description of the revision.
  - At least one image of revisions to the relevant portion of the prototype.

- Present your **final paper prototype**, as revised in this process.
  Your design may have changed more or less,
  so this is intended to fully convey the current state of your design.
  As before, ensure your prototype is complete, is at an appropriate level of detail, and documents each focus task.
  Include both:
  - An overview image that shows your entire paper prototype.
  - Detailed images showing each step in a walkthrough of your two focus tasks.

As you assemble this documentation of the iterative development of your design,
you may find that some changes feel minor relative to the overhead of documenting those changes.
Your goals in this documentation are to:
- Show your work in the iterative design process, giving enough insight to understand your progress.
- Capture a record of revisions to which you can return in communicating your design process.

You may choose to not fully document minor changes, but be sure to document enough for these two goals.

## Submission
