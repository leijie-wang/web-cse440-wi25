# Assignment 4.1: Paper Prototype

<UnderDevelopment display={false} />

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_4_1} />

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_4_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

The goal of this assignment is to develop an initial paper prototype that will support testing of your design.

__Develop a paper prototype__ that conveys critical components of your design,
including implementing support for testing based on a walkthrough of your two focus tasks.

The prototype should be complete for __two focus tasks__,
including enough detail to show how to complete each step in the task.
This should include the desired / expected / intended path through the focus task,
but also the most likely error conditions (e.g., if a person provides invalid input).

For each focus task, __develop a story__ that provides context and details
for understanding and interacting with your paper prototype.
Because designing a paper prototype to support any imaginable input is often not feasible
(e.g., a design that includes data entry might also include visualizations that cannot be anticipated),
details provided in this story will guide both development and testing of your paper prototype.

This paper prototype will be informed by your prior sketching and walkthroughs,
but will likely require more detail than your prior assignments.
If necessary or appropriate, revise your focus tasks based on what you learn in prototyping.

<InformalDrawingTool />

If you use an informal drawing tool,
you will need to have physical copies of your paper prototype available for usability testing.
You will also need the ability to quickly iterate on your paper prototype.

## Submission

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_4_1} />

Within the Drive folder for course project files:

- Identify the Slides deck corresponding to this assignment for your group.
  The deck provides a template for this assignment.
  Edit the deck in-place, so that you can easily share it in critique.

- Prepare a Slides deck with the following structure:

  Overall paper prototype:
    - 1 slide: Design title and brief description of its key idea or approach.
    - 1 slide: Overview image of entire paper prototype.

  For each focus task (2 total):
    - 1 slide: Focus task title.
    - 1 slide: Story providing context and details for paper prototype.
    - Multiple slides: Step-by-step task walkthrough with the paper prototype.

Reminders and requirements:

- Submission via Canvas is also required, in support of grading.
  - Remove instruction slides and template markings from your deck before submission.

  - Export a PDF of your deck, via the menu: File -> Download -> PDF Document (.pdf).

## In Class

For Friday's section, bring your paper prototype and be prepared to use it for usability testing.

## Completion Grading

This assignment will be graded on completion of the following components:

1. __Design Title & Summary__

   This may be taken directly from Milestone 3,
   or it might have evolved based on what you learned in prototyping.

2. __Overall Completeness and Appropriateness of Paper Prototype__

   Include an overview image of the entire paper prototype
   to convey critical components of your design and the context of your focus tasks.

   If you use an informal drawing tool,
   be sure this overview shows physical copies of your paper prototype available for usability testing.

3. __Focus Task Stories__

   For each focus task,
   include a story that provides context and details for understanding and interacting with your paper prototype.

4. __Focus Task Walkthroughs (2 total)__

   For each focus task, develop a step-by-step task walkthrough with your paper prototype.
   Include each step in the task, with enough detail to show how to complete each step.

5. __Clarity and Presentation__
