# Assignment 1.1: Individual Brainstorm

<UnderDevelopment display={false} />

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_1_1} />

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_1_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

The goal of this assignment is to help get you started in thinking of ideas for potential projects.
Friday's section will then build on these in brainstorming additional potential directions for project proposals.

Propose three potential ideas that are related to the course theme and could form the basis of a group project. 

Each idea should be just a sentence or two, identifying the domain and the problem, goal, or opportunity.
Your ideas must be significantly different, not small variations on the same idea.
