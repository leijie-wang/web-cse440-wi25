# Assignment 1.1: Individual Brainstorm

<UnderDevelopment display={false} />

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_1_1} />

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_1_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

The goal of this assignment is to help get you started in thinking of ideas for potential projects.
Friday's section will then build on these in brainstorming additional potential directions for project proposals.

Propose three starting points for brainstorming domains, problems, and goals that might be supported via self-tracking.

By domain, we mean an aspect of life. Domains that are already common in self-tracking include:

- Finances (e.g., tracking spending, a budget, investments).
- Wellness (e.g., tracking physical activity, sleep, weight).
- Health (e.g., tracking for pain management, allergies or other symptom triggers, major weight loss).
- Mood (e.g., tracking mood, identifying depressive symptoms).

Be sure to focus on problems, goals, and spaces of opportunity,
as it is too early to focus on a specific potential design solution.
One way to help yourself identify a related problems, goals, and opportunities is to ask "Why?". For example:

- Why is a person using a budgeting app?
- Why is a person tracking their spending?
- Why do they want to know how much they spend on leisure activities?
- Why do they have a goal of saving for a major purchase?

Each idea should be just a sentence or two, identifying the domain and the problem, goal, or opportunity.

Your ideas must be significantly different, not small variations on the same idea.
- Each idea must be in a different domain.
- At least one idea must be in a domain not in the above list.
