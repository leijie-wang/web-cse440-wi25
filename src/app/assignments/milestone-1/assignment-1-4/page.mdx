# Assignment 1.4: Design Ideation

<UnderDevelopment display={false} />

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_1_4} />

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_1_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

The goal of this assignment is to begin thinking about how to plan design research to inform your design process.

Generate 10 different ideas related to each of the following design dimensions of your project proposal:

- Forms: types of technology on which a design might be developed
  (e.g., wearables, watch/phone/tablet/laptop, appliances, other artifacts in an environment).
- Data: types of data a design might track or help a person track.
- Tasks: what a person might accomplish with a design.
- Features: a specific capability a design might have.
- Contexts for Interaction: Contexts in which a person might interact with a design
  (e.g., physical environments, social relationships, related goals or activities).

We will provide this worksheet to help structure this brainstorm:

<p><a href={Paths.basePath + pathDesignIdeationForm}>design-ideation-worksheet.pdf</a></p>

Write or sketch your ideas, one in each square.
Each idea should be either a single sentence or a quick drawing with a caption.
A person familiar with your project but not in your group should be able to understand each idea.

All ideas should be different.
The goal is to begin exploring the space of possibilities, not attempting to polish some individual possibility.
Focus on the quantity of ideas, and avoid become stuck on the quality of any one idea.
Ideate as a team to develop a greater range of ideas.
When you get stuck, find a context to inspire new ideas.

After this brainstorming, you will have a broad space of possible directions.
Your project will soon need to gather information on how to further generate and consider ideas in such directions.

Following up on the above, you should additionally brainstorm:

- People: types of people you might work with to learn more about problems and opportunities.
- Focus: specific aspects of problems and opportunities you might focus on learning more about.
- Method: how you might engage such people to learn more about problems and opportunities.

## Submission

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_1_4} />
